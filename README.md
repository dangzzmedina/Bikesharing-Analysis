##Overview of the statistical analysis:

###The statistical analysis with Tableau helped us to visualize in a user friendly program stats that would help CEO/investors in their decision making to invest on a bike-sharing program in a new city with the analysis of NYC Citibike. In my analysis, I found out that many of the bike riders are subscribers, and individuals who like excercising after work. There is more than twice as many men using  bike-sharing rides than women. This analysis also helps the investor analyze where the advertising budget should be used appropriately. Moreover, I found out that cities tend to use bike rides ofter for health purposes or short distance travels/tourism. Finally, the statistical analysis shares insight in product maintenance to avoid client dissatisfaction and increase productivity around the city.
